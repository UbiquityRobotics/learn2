Connecting to the Robot
=======================

Magni 6 robots broadcast their own Wi-Fi network by default.
You can connect via this Wi-Fi or integrate the robot into your local network.

.. note:: 

    When first unboxed or after flashing a fresh image, the robot will always start by broadcasting its own Wi-Fi network.

.. warning:: 

    While connected to the robot's Wi-Fi, you will **not** have internet access. 
    To use both the robot and the internet, switch to the local network option.

Before continuing, ensure your workstation is set up: :doc:`../requirements/workstation`.

Option 1: Connect via Robot's Wi-Fi
###################################

.. note:: 

    This section assumes you already unboxed and set up the robot.

    
1. Power on the robot.

2. Connect your computer to the Wi-Fi network:

    - **SSID:** ``UbiquityRobotXXXX``
    - **Password:** ``robotseverywhere``

3. Open a terminal and SSH into the robot:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ssh ubuntu@192.168.4.1

    .. important:: 

        The IP ``192.168.4.1`` is static and is valid for all of the robots.

        Meaning that for every robot, when the robot emits its own Wi-Fi you can SSH through this IP.

4. Enter the SSH password when prompted: **ubuntu**. Note that the password will not be visible while typing.

You are now connected directly to the robot.

.. TODO: Here you can add the outcome of the ssh of the robot, do the ls command or something inside the robot.

**Coming soon:** step-by-step video tutorial.

If you successfully connected to the robot you can now drive it through the terminal.
Follow this guide: :doc:`./teleop` to see how to do it.


Option 2: Connect via Local Network 
###################################

.. important::
    
    This method allows simultaneous access to the robot **and** the internet.


1. First connect to the robot via robots Wi-Fi (see :ref:`Option 1 <connect_AP>`).

2. From the SSH session, connect the robot to your Wi-Fi network:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo nmcli device wifi connect <Local_Netowork_name> password <password>


Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo nmcli device wifi connect mywifi password mypass1234

3. Find the robot's new IP address on your router (hostname: ``ubiquityrobotXXXX``).

4. SSH into the robot using the IP:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh ubuntu@[ROBOT_IP]

You are now connected through the local network with the internet access.

**Coming soon:** step-by-step video tutorial.

Test your connection by driving the robot: :doc:`./teleop`.

Next Steps
##########

Now that your robot is connected with internet access, you can start interacting with it.
A good first step is driving the robot manually. 

We provide two simple options:

- :doc:`Driving the robot through the terminal <./teleop>` which you may have already tested if you followed the guide.
- :doc:`Driving the robot through our custom mapping application <./ez_map_simple_drive>`

Try them out to verify your setup and begin exploring the robot's capabilities.
