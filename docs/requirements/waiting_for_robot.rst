Waiting for Your Robot
======================

This section covers what you'll need to prepare before your Ubiquity Robot arrives. 

Requirements
############

1. **12V Batteries (2x)**
-------------------------

.. important:: 
    The robot ships without battery so you have to purchase them separetely.
    More information in the batteries page.

The robots require two 12V batteries to opearate. We recommened lead-acid batteries.
Make sure they are safely mounted and connected as per your model's guidelines.

As this is a very important topic please read :doc:`./batteries` for specific details.

2. Workstation (SSH Capable)
----------------------------
You will need a laptop or desktop computer capable of SSH connections to connect to the robot.
This workstation will be used for tasks such as remote access, updates, and running software tools on the robot.
To properly set up your workstation please see: :doc:`./workstation`
