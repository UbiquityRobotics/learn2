Waiting for Your Robot
======================

This section covers what you'll need to prepare before your Ubiquity Robot arrives. 

Requirements
############
1. 12V Batteries (2x)
---------------------

.. important:: 
    The robot ships without battery so you have to purchase them separetely.
    More information in the batteries page.

The robots require two 12V batteries to opearate. We recommened lead-acid batteries.
Make sure they are safely mounted and connected as per your model's guidelines.

As this is a very important topic please read :doc:`./batteries` for specific details.

2. Workstation (SSH Capable)
----------------------------

You will need a laptop or desktop computer capable of SSH connections to connect to the robot.
This workstation will be used for tasks such as remote access, updates, and running software tools on the robot.
To properly set up your workstation please see: :doc:`./workstation`

3. Simulation
-------------

Once your Ubuntu 24.04 workstation is set up, you can try out the Magni 6 Mini in :doc:`./simulation`.
The simulation lets you explore how the robot works, practice using our system, and test your setup before using the real robot.

It's also a cost-effective way to evaluate whether our solution fits your needs before pruchasing the physical robot.


4. Robot's Image
----------------

The Magni 6 robots use a custom software image that comes pre-installed on the robot.
If you want to explore other versions or experiment with the system, you can find them here: :doc:`./images.rst`

.. note::
    
    Older images may be marked as deprecated. 
    We strongly recommend using the latest version for best compatibility and support.

    If you believe an older image better suits your needs and enouncter issues, please contact us at `Ubiquity Robotics support <support@ubiquityrobotics.com>`_.
