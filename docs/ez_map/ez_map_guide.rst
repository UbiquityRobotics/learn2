EZ-MAP Guide
============

Connecting to EZ-MAP
#########
To start using the EZ-MAP webapp, you should first connect to the robot. See :doc:`../driving/connecting` for details. Note down the robot's IP.

.. note::
    The primary targeted devices are smartphones and tablets since it's easier to follow the robot around with them. However, almost all common phones, tablets, and laptops should work.

The EZ-MAP interface is available on the webpage:

.. code-block:: bash

    http://<ROBOT-IP>:3000

.. warning::
   If you are connected to the robot using the access point, you will **not** have internet access. Therefore, if you are using a device with enabled mobile data transfer, disable it before connecting, since the mobile device won't route packets through the robot by default. To use both the robot and the internet, switch to the local network option. See :doc:`../driving/connecting` for details.

Optional: Add to Home Screen
#########
.. note:: 
    The app can be used straight away. However, saving it as a home screen app (see the image below) eliminates certain usage issues, so it is encouraged.

On certain occasions the required manifest file is not sent (③) which when saved will not launch the full screen setup properly. Please repeat the addition (and cancel unless the icon is shown) until it appears properly.

   :width: 55px

When the robot first starts, you’ll be asked to provide a location and orientation for your sensors. The process can also be skipped by opening and closing the menu once and can later be accessed in the calibration menu (|calibration_button|).

This step is absolutely essential to make sure your robot is configured properly.

Menus and actions
#########

The app contains a collection of submenus and actions represented by icons that are described in this section. The icons should always be visible somewhere in the app interface, however, their size and location differ depending on the screen orientation. Since the design of EZ-MAP is modular, these can be added or removed, or you can even write your own custom ones.

|view_switch_icon|

Pressing it swaps the app's main views, which are by default the camera video stream and the navigation system, showing a map of the robot's surroundings generated by the LIDAR.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/icons/100.svg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP battery widget icon
   :width: 55px

Shows the percentage charge of the robot’s battery. When pressed, it shows a menu with voltage and percentage values. 

.. warning::
    Lead acid batteries should not be deep-cycled for best longevity. It is also best to keep them in the range of 50-100%, otherwise, system issues can occur due to excessive voltage drops. See :doc:`../requirements/batteries` for details


|calibration_button|

A collection of three different setup menus that allow easy setup of the robot’s lidar, camera, and wheels. This should ideally be done before use to make sure the robot performs as expected.


.. image:: /_static/ez_map/icons/record_off.svg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP record widget icon
   :width: 55px

Opens the menu that lets the user record all of the robot’s current internal data as a rosbag file (with an option for AVI video export) to an external USB drive (if plugged in) or onto the SD card. 


.. image:: /_static/ez_map/icons/photo.svg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP photo widget icon
   :width: 55px

Takes a photo from the video stream and downloads it through the browser to your device directly.

.. warning::
    On some browsers this may override the current tab.


.. image:: /_static/ez_map/icons/map_defaults_settings.svg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP map defaults settings widget icon
   :width: 55px

Opens a menu that lets the user set default options for the map on EZ-MAP boot.

|settings_icon|

Opens a menu for all general robot settings: speed limits, control scheme, system power, etc.


.. image:: /_static/ez_map/settings_menu.jpg

   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

.. note::
   Powering off and rebooting the robot is not instant. After pressing the buttons it will take about a minute to take effect.

|



Remote control
#########
Assuming the camera is connected correctly, one of the main two screens (|view_switch_icon|) should show the video stream from the robot.

The robot can be driven around using the joysticks which show up by default, see :doc:`../driving/ez_map_simple_drive` for details.

.. note::
    You can select alternative control schemes in the settings menu (|settings_icon|).


.. image:: /_static/ez_map/ezmap_video_stream.png
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP video stream
   :width: 400px
|

.. note:: 
    If the battery widget appears as gray (|uninitialized_battery_icon|), then the MCB and motor node have not yet connected, and you may need to wait a few more seconds until the robot is ready to go. If it persists for longer than a minute or two, then it may be an indicator that there’s something wrong with the motor control.


Mapping
#########
To start mapping the robot's surroundings, first switch to the navigation view (|view_switch_icon|). The interface shown should look as follows:

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/ezmap_navigation_view.jpg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP navigation view
   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

.. note::
    If the screen shows a checklist (see image below) instead of the mapped surroundings, give the system a minute to start or move the robot around slightly so the lidar can gather more data for the initial map iteration. If the message persists for longer, it’s likely that the system has not received the required data for functioning: i.e., the motor node hasn’t started yet (no battery info), or the lidar hasn’t been connected or configured properly. The checklist should give you an idea of what is missing.

Map Management
--------
Clicking the map management icon (|map_management_icon|) opens a dropdown menu where one can inspect the currently saved maps, select one for loading, or launch the creation of a new map and subsequently save it. Resetting the map will clear the currently displayed version of the map and does not affect saved maps. It will also place the starting point (coordinate 0,0) to the robot’s current location.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/map_dropdown.jpg

   :align: center
   :width: 100px
|

The robot's mapping software can operate in two modes:

#. When the robot is in **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) mode, also known as just "mapping" mode, it's operating in a fully or partly unknown environment. The robot simultaneously builds a new map or extends an existing map of its surroundings while also keeping track of its own position within that developing map.

#. In **Localization Mode**, the robot uses a pre-existing map that has been loaded and locked. The robot will try to determine its precise location relative to the features on that static map.

**INCOMING EXPLORATION MODE EXPLANATION**

   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

.. warning::
   Maps are not automatically saved. If you want to save changes, make sure you save the map again.

.. note::
   It is possible to switch from the SLAM (mapping) mode to a localization-only mode at any time by clicking the bottom slider. When a saved map is loaded, it will automatically go into localization mode, so the map is preserved as-is. However, you can switch back to mapping to extend existing maps.

Landmarks
-------
The hybrid particle filter SLAM also supports landmarks as a way to improve localization accuracy. These are set up to be ArUco markers that can be printed out and laid out around in view of the camera. Once located with reasonable accuracy, they will be implemented into the map and rendered as shown below.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/landmark.png

   :width: 100px
|

.. note::
   In order to get the correct positional data, it is crucial to set up the camera position. This can be done in the calibration menu (|calibration_button|).
.. Will this be already set up in the images?


Localizing on a loaded map
-------
On loading a new map, the robot may not be in the same place as when it was when the map was created. As such, it may be shown out of position:

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/unlocalized_map.png
   :alt: Image of a unlocalized EZ-MAP map
   :width: 600px
|

To help the system gain a good starting point, you can drag and drop the robot to a new location in a way that the red dots align with the black walls. After the robot is dropped, an arrow will appear showing the forward direction. On mobile, it requires another tap and drag for rotation, while on desktop, you just need to move the mouse and click once.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/positioning_localization_map.png
   :alt: Image of positioning the robot in EZ-MAP
   :width: 400px
|

Once the red dots vaguely align with the walls, you can let go and the system will localize the robot. Once the robot moves a little, it should snap to the map and confirm its position.

Routes
######

.. |route_drive_stop_icon| image:: /_static/ez_map/icons/route_cancel.svg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP stop icon
   :width: 55px

Clicking the route management icon (|route_management_icon|) opens the route menu window, where routes can be selected, added, and deleted.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/route_menu.png
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP route menu
   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

.. note::
   Routes are automatically saved along with a map. If the map isn’t saved, the route changes will be discarded on shutdown. If you are using an existing map, the routes will auto-save to the map location.

Creating a route
--------
Double-tapping anywhere on the map allows you to add a new goal or prompts you for the creation of the first route. Unselected routes of the same map are drawn as greyed out.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/route_creation.png
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP route creation
   :width: 600px
|

Once a route is created and selected, you can double-click/tap on the map to add and remove new goals. Double-tapping on the line between goals also creates a new goal between them. You can, of course, also drag goals around to make adjustments.

Robot Movement
-------
When the route is set, press one of the movement buttons to send the robot forward (|route_drive_forward_icon|) or backward (|route_drive_backward_icon|) (opposite the drawn arrows in the UI) along the specified route.

The robot will then first proceed to the nearest goal and then follow the route onwards to the last point, where it will stop, unless the route is a loop, in which case it’ll continue driving until stopped.

If the robot is in motion, one of the previous two buttons will change to a stop icon (|route_drive_stop_icon|), and pressing it will stop the robot and cancel the route.

Goal Actions
----------
When you have a route set up, the next step is to define actions executed upon reaching a goal. Hold down your mouse/finger on a goal until the Actions menu appears.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/actions_menu.png
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP actions menu
   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

As the robot arrives at the specified goal, it will then check the defined actions and execute them sequentially one after the other.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/goal_action_example.png
   :alt: Image of an example EZ-MAP goal action setup
   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

In the above example the robot would:

-    wait for one second
-    set the movement speed to as fast as possible
-    execute a speech to text command on the robot (requires a speaker)

The goal will change the color and shape of the node to indicate stored actions.

   :width: 400px
|

.. note::
    The command line functionality allows for running custom scripts at specific points in the route or sending data to other parts of the system.

Looping
-----
There are currently two ways to create perpetual driving:

#. Simply moving the first and last goal together (requires a minimum of three goals). The route will then turn purple to indicate successful looping.

    .. image:: /_static/ez_map/looped_route.png
       :alt: Image of a looped EZ-MAP route 
       :width: 800px
    |

    .. note::
        As the first and last goals are joined together, only the first goal will execute its defined actions (as the last goal is never processed).
   
#. Creating so-called ping-pong looping, which is to set the first and last goal to trigger the route in opposite ways using actions.

    .. image:: /_static/ez_map/ping_pong_looping.png
       :alt: Image of a ping-pong looped EZ-MAP route 
       :align: center
       :width: 800px
    |
    The robot should then drive the route one way, then reverse and return to the start, and continue forward again. By removing the “Forward” action, we also get go-and-return behavior, for example. There are further possible combinations by setting the drive commands to other routes, which lets you chain different routes together.

Locking
------
In the case of small devices, it may be easier to lock the positions of goals so they are not accidentally moved when setting up actions. The route management menu has an option labeled [🔒 Lock Goal Movement] which will globally lock route editing until you turn it back on.

Initialization Triggers
######

.. |global_triggers_menu_icon| image:: /_static/ez_map/icons/route_trigger.svg
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP global route trigger menu icon 
   :width: 55px
|

The global triggers menu (|global_triggers_menu_icon|) lets you set a string of actions that will be executed once the set conditions are met. The actions are much the same as the ones you can set on specific goals; however, they will be triggered globally by some sort of event instead of the robot arriving at the goal. The functionality can be enabled or disabled in order to easily set up and reset the cooldown timers of triggers.

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/triggers_example1.png
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP global triggers example
   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

In this example we see that the executed actions will be the following:

- Upon spotting the ArUco marker number 3, the robot will wait 1 second and then slow down movement
- If the battery drops below 60% the robot will stop route driving

.. note:: 
    Triggers (and actions) are web app independent, so they will run in the background regardless of the webapp running in a browser.

Another example below will load a saved map upon seeing marker 23, then start a predefined route on the map at max speed:

.. image:: /_static/ez_map/triggers_example2.png
   :alt: Image of the EZ-MAP global triggers example
   :align: center
   :width: 800px
|

This trigger allows for driving the robot using remote control into a room so it sees the marker, upon which it takes over and runs the automated route.

.. note:: 
   At present time the robot does **NOT** do global initial localization, so it should be rotated and positioned as close to the map’s starting point / origin as possible for best results.
