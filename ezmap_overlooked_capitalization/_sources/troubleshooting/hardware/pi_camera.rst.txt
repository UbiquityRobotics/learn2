Pi Camera 3 Module
==================

What is the Raspberry Pi Camera Module?
#######################################

The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 is compact 12-megapixel camera that connects directly to the Rasbperry Pi inside the Magni robot.
It features autofocus and strong low-light performance, making it useful for capturing photos and videos in a variety of conditions.
Integrated with the robot's software, it provides vision of the robot's surroundings for navigation, monitoring, and projects.

Why is the Camera Useful?
#########################

- **See in Low Light**: Takes clear pictures even when it's dark, great for night projects.
- **Auto Focus**: Adjusts focus on its own, making it easy to capture moving objects.
- **Wide Views**: Comes in standard or wide-angle versions to see more around the robot. The robot comes with the wide version, but you can always switch it for the standard version if you wish.

Basic Setup
###########

.. note::

    The robot ships with the Pi Camera Module 3 Wide already installed and ready to use.


If you want to switch to the standard camera module and run into trouble with the hardware/sofware please contact us at `Ubiquity Robotics support <support@ubiquityrobotics.com>`_.

Project Suggestion
##################

A suggested project to get familiar with the Pi Camera would be the following: 

- **Live Video Patrol**: Use the Raspberry Pi Camera to stream live video, turning the Magni 6 Mini into a mobile surveillance bot. Great for remote monitoring.
